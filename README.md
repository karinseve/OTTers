Number of topic pairs for each data split:
- **in-domain**: allows one of the topics in each pair of the `test` set to appear in the `train` set, although with a different second topic,
- **out-of-domain**: none of the topics in the `test` set are present in any of the topic-pairs in the `train` set.
