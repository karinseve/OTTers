# OTTers ðŸ¦¦: One-turn Topic Transitions for Open-Domain Dialogue

## Data

### Data Statistics
You can download the data already divided in the two `in-domain` and `out-of-domain` splits.


Number of topic pairs for each data split:
- **in-domain**: allows one of the topics in each pair of the `test` set to appear in the `train` set, although with a different second topic,
- **out-of-domain**: none of the topics in the `test` set are present in any of the topic-pairs in the `train` set.

|                   | Train | Dev | Test |
| ----              | ----  |    ----     |    ----    | 
| `in-domain`    | 1929  |    1160  |    1158     |
| `out-of-domain`  | 2034 |   1152    |    1130   |
